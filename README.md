> Single page application to manage an ad API. Based on the previous <a href="https://github.com/chitenavi/practica7-fundamentos-react" target="_blank">React project</a>, Redux has been used, with its store, actions...

> New components have been added and the entire app refactored. Application forms use the Form component, created to extract common logic using the Context API and Hooks.
